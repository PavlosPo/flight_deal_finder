### flight_deal_finder

Here we use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in combination with HTTPS Requests.
We retrieve data from a Google Sheet, update, delete information.
We also retrieve the correct IATA Codes per Country written on the Google Sheet and updates the file constantly.

**GOAL: To send an SMS to my moblie phone whenever a cheaper flight is found by the Kiwi Api.**
